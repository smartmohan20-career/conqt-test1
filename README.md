# conqt-test1

## Notes
I did not have PostgreSQL installed on my machine, so I approached the implementation based on assumptions and without using external tools like Google or GPT. While I could not complete the full implementation due to time constraints, I focused on delivering a clear and logical approach.

As a quality coder, I have delivered high-quality, large-scale projects individually in the past. However, completing the entire assignment manually within the given timeframe was not feasible. I am happy to provide references to my previous work for a better understanding of my capabilities.

### Sample Projects
Here are some projects I completed individually:

- [Team Sync](https://teams-sync.mojowebtech.com)
- [Team Sync API](https://api-team-sync.mojowebtech.com)
- [CollegeGram](https://collegegram.onrender.com/)
- [Accident Advertising](https://accidentadvertising.ai/)
- [Marketing Tool](https://mojowebtech.com/apps/MarketingTool)
- [Consentz Staging](https://staging.consentz.com)

If you have any questions or require further clarification, feel free to contact me at [career.smartmohan@gmail.com](mailto:career.smartmohan@gmail.com).

As a working professional, my time to complete this assignment without tools like Google or GPT was limited. I look forward to discussing this further if needed.
